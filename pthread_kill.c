      * DOCPUBLIC
      *      This function requests that a signal be delivered to the
      *      specified thread. If sig is zero, error checking is
      *      performed but no signal is actually sent such that this
      *      function can be used to check for a valid thread ID.
      *
      * PARAMETERS
      *      thread  reference to an instances of pthread_t
      *      sig     signal. Currently only a value of 0 is supported.
      *

      * DESCRIPTION
      *      This function requests that a signal be delivered to the

      *
      * RESULTS
      *              ESRCH           the thread is not a valid thread ID,
      *              EINVAL          the value of the signal is invalid
      *                              or unsupported.
      *              0               the signal was successfully sent.
