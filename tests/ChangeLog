	* Makefile: Now actually runs the tests.

	* tests.h: Define our own assert macro. The Mingw32
	version pops up a dialog but we want to run non-interactively.

	* equal1.c: use assert a little more directly so that it
	prints the actual call statement.

	* exit1.c: Modify to return 0 on success, 1 on failure.

1999-02-22  Ross Johnson  <rpj@ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* self2.c: Bring up to date.

	* self3.c: Ditto.

1999-02-21  Ben Elliston  <bje@cygnus.com>

	* README: Update.

	* Makefile: New file. Run all tests automatically. Primitive tests
	are run first; more complex tests are run last.

	* count1.c: New test. Validate the thread count.

	* exit2.c: Perform a simpler test.
	
	* exit3.c: New test. Replaces exit2.c, since exit2.c needs to
	perform simpler checking first.

	* create1.c: Update to use the new testsuite exiting convention.
	
	* equal1.c: Likewise.

	* mutex1.c: Likewise.

	* mutex2.c: Likewise.

	* once1.c: Likewise.

	* self2.c: Likewise.

	* self3.c: Likewise.

	* tsd1.c: Likewise.

1999-02-20  Ross Johnson  <rpj@ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* mutex2.c: Test static mutex initialisation.

	* test.h: New. Declares a table mapping error numbers to
	error names.

1999-01-17  Ross Johnson  <rpj@ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* runtest: New script to build and run a test in the tests directory.

Wed Dec 30 11:22:44 1998  Ross Johnson  <rpj@ixobrychus.canberra.edu.au>

	* tsd1.c: Re-written. See comments at start of file.
	* Template.c: New. Contains skeleton code and comment template
	intended to fully document the test.

Fri Oct 16 17:59:49 1998  Ross Johnson  <rpj@swan.canberra.edu.au>

	* tsd1.c (destroy_key): Add function. Change diagnostics.

Thu Oct 15 17:42:37 1998  Ross Johnson  <rpj@swan.canberra.edu.au>

	* tsd1.c (mythread): Fix some casts and add some message
	output. Fix inverted conditional.

Mon Oct 12 02:12:29 1998  Ross Johnson  <rpj@ixobrychus.canberra.edu.au>

	* tsd1.c: New. Test TSD using 1 key and 2 threads.

1998-09-13  Ben Elliston  <bje@cygnus.com>

	* eyal1.c: New file; contributed by Eyal Lebedinsky
	<eyal@eyal.emu.id.au>.

1998-09-12  Ben Elliston  <bje@cygnus.com>

	* exit2.c (func): Return a value.
	(main): Call the right thread entry function.

1998-07-22  Ben Elliston  <bje@cygnus.com>

	* exit2.c (main): Fix size of pthread_t array.

1998-07-10  Ben Elliston  <bje@cygnus.com>

	* exit2.c: New file; test pthread_exit() harder.

	* exit1.c: New file; test pthread_exit().
