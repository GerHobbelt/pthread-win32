                 PTHREADS-WIN32 SNAPSHOT 2001-07-12
                 ----------------------------------
       Web Site: http://sources.redhat.com/pthreads-win32/
      FTP Site: ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/pthreads-win32
        Coordinator: Ross Johnson <rpj@ise.canberra.edu.au>


We are pleased to announce the availability of a new snapshot of
Pthreads-win32, an Open Source Software implementation of the
Threads component of the POSIX 1003.1c 1995 Standard for Microsoft's
Win32 environment. Some functions from POSIX 1003.1b are also
supported including semaphores. Other related functions include
the set of read-write lock functions.

Parts of the implementation also comply with the Open Group's
Single Unix specification for compatibility with major Unix
implementations and Linux.

Pthreads-win32 is free software, distributed under the GNU Library
General Public License (LGPL).

Please see the 'Acknowledgements' section at the end of this
announcement for the list of contributors.


Changes since the last snapshot
-------------------------------

----------------------------------
New: Spin locks (beta level code)
----------------------------------
These are part of POSIX 1003.1j.

        #define _POSIX_SPIN_LOCKS
        pthread_spin_init()
        pthread_spin_destroy()
        pthread_spin_lock()
        pthread_spin_unlock()
        pthread_spin_trylock()
        PTHREAD_SPINLOCK_INITIALIZER

Spin_lock spins (busy-waits) if more than one processor is available
to the process, othewise it is equivalent to a POSIX_MUTEX_DEFAULT
mutex. The spinlock routines do minimal error checking.

--------------------------------
New: Barriers (beta level code)
--------------------------------
These are part of POSIX 1003.1j.

        #define _POSIX_BARRIERS
        pthread_barrier_init()
        pthread_barrier_destroy()
        pthread_barrier_wait()
        pthread_barrierattr_init()
        pthread_barrierattr_destroy()
        pthread_barrierattr_getpshared()
        pthread_barrierattr_setpshared()

---------
Bug fixes
---------
In pthread_mutex_lock, return the error if an
auto-initialiser initialisation fails.

_POSIX_READER_WRITER_LOCKS is now defined.

pthread_rwlock_wrlock() was a cancelation point.

---------------------------
Known bugs in this snapshot
---------------------------

1. Under MS VC++ (only tested with version 6.0), a term_func
   set via the standard C++ set_terminate() function is not called
   for some reason. The code in private.c ptw32_threadStart()
   retrieves and calls the user supplied terminate routine, which
   works as expected under MinGW32 g++, but doesn't run under
   MS VC++ 6.0, presumably because set_terminate() returns NULL.

2. Cancellation problems in optimised code
   - Milan Gardian

   The cancellation (actually, cleanup-after-cancel) tests fail when using VC
   (professional) optimisation switches (/O1 or /O2) in pthreads library. I
   have not investigated which concrete optimisation technique causes this
   problem (/Og, /Oi, /Ot, /Oy, /Ob1, /Gs, /Gf, /Gy, etc.), but here is a
   summary of builds and corresponding failures:

     * pthreads VSE (optimised tests): OK
     * pthreads VCE (optimised tests): Failed "cleanup1" test (runtime)
   
     * pthreads VSE (DLL in CRT, optimised tests): OK
     * pthreads VCE (DLL in CRT, optimised tests): Failed "cleanup1" test
   (runtime)

   Please note that while in VSE version of the pthreads library the
   optimisation does not really have any impact on the tests (they pass OK), in
   VCE version addition of optimisation (/O2 in this case) causes the tests to
   fail uniformly - either in "cleanup0" or "cleanup1" test cases.
   
   Please note that all the tests above use default pthreads DLL (no
   optimisations, linked with either static or DLL CRT, based on test type).
   Therefore the problem lies not within the pthreads DLL but within the
   compiled client code (the application using pthreads -> involvement of
   "pthread.h").

   I think the message of this section is that usage of VCE version of pthreads
   in applications relying on cancellation/cleanup AND using optimisations for
   creation of production code is highly unreliable for the current version of
   the pthreads library.


Caveats
-------

1. Due to what is believed to be a C++ compliance error in VC++,
if your application contains catch(...) blocks in your POSIX threads
then you will need to replace the "catch(...)" with the macro
"PtW32Catch", eg.

	#ifdef PtW32Catch
		PtW32Catch {
			...
		}
	#else
		catch(...) {
			...
		}
	#endif

Otherwise neither pthreads cancelation nor pthread_exit() will work
reliably.

Availability
------------ 

The prebuilt DLL, export libs (for both MSVC and Mingw32), and the header
files (pthread.h, semaphore.h, sched.h) are available along with the
complete source code.

The source code can be found at:

	ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/pthreads-win32

and as individual source code files at

	ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/pthreads-win32/source

The pre-built DLL, export libraries and include files can be found at:

	ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/pthreads-win32/dll-latest


      
Mailing List 
------------  
      
There is a mailing list for discussing pthreads on Win32. To join,
send email to:

        pthreads-win32-subscribe@sourceware.cygnus.com
      

Application Development Environments
------------------------------------

See the README file for more information.
      
MSVC:
MSVC using SEH works. Distribute pthreadVSE.dll with your application.
MSVC using C++ EH works. Distribute pthreadVCE.dll with your application.
MSVC using C setjmp/longjmp works. Distribute pthreadVC.dll with your application.


Mingw32:
You need gcc-2.95.2-1 modified as per pthreads-win32 FAQ answer (6), with
binutils-19990818-1 and msvcrt runtime-2000-03-27. Mingw32 must use
the thread-safe MSVCRT library (see the FAQ). You need to distribute
the gcc.dll DLL from Mingw32 with your application.

Mingw using C++ EH works. Distribute pthreadGCE.dll with your application.
Mingw using C setjmp/longjmp works. Distribute pthreadGC.dll with your application.


Cygwin: (http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/)
Cygwin aims to provide a complete POSIX environment on top of Win32, including
threads. When this is complete, developers using Cygwin will not need
pthreads-win32. At this time, Cygwin has preliminary support for multithreaded
development, however, this is not turned on by default. We have not tested
pthreads-win32 against Cygwin.


UWIN:
UWIN is a complete Unix-like environment for Windows from AT&T. Pthreads-win32
doesn't currently support UWIN (and vice versa), but that may change in the
future.

Generally:
For convenience, the following pre-built files are available on the FTP site
(see Availability above):

	pthread.h	- for POSIX 1c threads
	semaphore.h	- for POSIX 1b semaphores
	sched.h		- for POSIX 1b scheduling
	pthreadVCE.dll	- built with MSVC++ compiler using C++ EH
	pthreadVCE.lib
	pthreadVC.dll	- built with MSVC compiler using C setjmp/longjmp
	pthreadVC.lib
	pthreadVSE.dll	- built with MSVC compiler using SEH
	pthreadVSE.lib
	pthreadGCE.dll	- built with Mingw32 G++ 2.95.2-1
	pthreadGC.dll	- built with Mingw32 GCC 2.95.2-1 using setjmp/longjmp
	libpthreadGCE.a	- derived from pthreadGCE.dll
	libpthreadGC.a	- derived from pthreadGC.dll
        gcc.dll         - needed if distributing applications that use pthreadGCE.dll

These are the only files you need in order to build POSIX threads
applications for Win32 using either MSVC or Mingw32.
      
See the FAQ file in the source tree for additional information.


Documentation
-------------

Currently, there is no documentation included in the package apart
from the copious comments in the source code.

For POSIX Thread API programming, several reference books are
available:

        Addison-Wesley (pub)

Acknowledgements
----------------
      
This library is based substantially on a Win32 pthreads
implementation contributed by John Bossom <John.Bossom@cognos.com>.
      
The implementation of Condition Variables uses algorithms developed
by Alexander Terekhov and Louis Thomas.

The implementation of POSIX mutexes has been improved by Thomas Pfaff.

The implementation of read/write locks was contributed by
Aurelio Medina and improved by Alexander Terekhov.

Many others have contributed significant time and effort to solve critical
problems in order to make the library workable, robust and reliable.

There is also a separate CONTRIBUTORS file. This file and others are
on the web site:

        http://sources.redhat.com/pthreads-win32

As much as possible, the ChangeLog file acknowledges contributions to the
code base in more detail.

Enjoy!
