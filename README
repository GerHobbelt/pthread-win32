Building the library with Cygwin32 or Mingw32
---------------------------------------------
Feb 18, 1999

If you have a suitable environment then you can run the configure script,
otherwise you should edit "Makefile" and "config.h" as required.

gcc cannot be used because the library requires C++ EH. g++ must be usedi
(but see below).

The DLL pthread.dll still cannot be built using g++ due to non thread-safe
exception handling in g++.  Thanks to Kevin Ruland for researching this
one. See the FAQ Question 2 for more information.

However, you can use the export library libpthread32.a built under
Mingw32 (not tested under Cygwin32) together with the pthread.dll built
with MSVC. Thanks to Anders Norlander for pointing this out.

For convenience, the following pre-built files can be downloaded from
the FTP site (see under "Availability" below):

	pthread.h	- the standard include file
	pthread.dll	- built with MSVC cl compiler
	pthread.lib	- built with MSVC cl compiler
	libpthread32.a	- built with Mingw32 (use with MSVC pthread.dll)

With these files in the same directory as your application myapp.c,
you could compile, link and run myapp.c under Mingw32 as follows:

	gcc -o myapp.exe myapp.c -I. -L. -lpthread32
	myapp

Or put pthread.dll in an appropriate directory in your PATH,
put libpthread32.a in MINGW_ROOT\i386-mingw32\lib, and
put pthread.h in MINGW_ROOT\i386-mingw32\include, then use:

	gcc -o myapp.exe myapp.c -lpthread32
	myapp
